# Roundshot - upgradable OS image build system

This software takes the tar.gz of a GNU/Linux operating system
(i.e. the rootfs image produced by the
[https://github.com/DECODEproject/os-build-system](os-build-system)
using Devuan's SDK) and builds a ramdisk using busybox, musl-libc, a
squashfs image and a uboot patched Linux kernel.

It results in a directory ready to be copied to an SDcard with init
scripts that manage booting, mounting the overlayfs over the squashfs
image (for variable data) and eventually checking updates on a
configured website, verifying their hash and signature and replacing
the squashfs with the new version.

Roundshot is aimed at readability and verifiability of this
process: it is mostly made of shell scripts and GNU makefile standard
targets, while keeping all the source-code short and readable.

Right now roundshot is deployed specifically for the DECODE project
and is tailored to target Olimex Lime2 boards with a Linux kernel
patched with grsec.

## List of components

Being in charge of compositing a boot system that checks online for
signed upgrades, the main components managed by roundshot are the
kernel, the filesystem and the ramdisk.

### Linux kernel

The kernel used is Linux 4.9 hardened with grsec patches.

### Filesystem

The filesystems used are overlayfs, squashfs and btrfs.

### Initramfs

The first 'volatile' stage of the booting is made in a minimal ramdisk
containing only: busybox, udhcpc, gpgv and a keyring.

## Startup sequence

For an outline of the operations executed by the ramdisk, reading the
[/blob/master/initramfs/skel/init](init file) is self-explanatory to
anyone with a bit of shell-scripting. Here an excerpt of the main
operations:

```sh
/bin/busybox --install -s /bin

mount -t devtmpfs none /dev
mount -t proc none /proc
mount -t sysfs none /sys

echo " * enabling eth0"
ip link set eth0 up || rescue_shell
sleep 2

echo " * requesting dhcp"
udhcpc || rescue_shell
sleep 2

echo " * setting time from ntp"
ntpd -q -p pool.ntp.org || rescue_shell
sleep 2

echo " * mounting mmcblk0p1"
mkdir -p /mnt/mmc0p1
mount -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p1 /mnt/mmc0p1

perform_update 2>&1 | tee update.log

mkdir -p /mnt/ro
mkdir -p /mnt/rw
mkdir -p /mnt/overlay

echo " * mounting squashfs to /mnt/ro"
mount -t squashfs /mnt/mmc0p1/filesystem.squashfs /mnt/ro

storage=$(egrep -o 'storage[^ ]*' /proc/cmdline | sed 's/storage=//')
echo " * mounting $storage to /mnt/rw"
mount -t btrfs $storage /mnt/rw

mkdir -p /mnt/rw/upper
mkdir -p /mnt/rw/work
echo " * mounting overlayfs to /mnt/overlay"
mount -t overlay -o lowerdir=/mnt/ro,upperdir=/mnt/rw/upper,workdir=/mnt/rw/work overlay /mnt/overlay

mount --move /dev /mnt/overlay/dev || rescue_shell
umount /proc /sys
echo " * switching root"
exec switch_root /mnt/overlay /sbin/init
```
